#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix Dataset

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the media content available on the platform. The analysis includes examining the distribution, trends, and relationships within the dataset, focusing on key attributes such as movie and TV show runtimes, release years, genres, and actor participation.
